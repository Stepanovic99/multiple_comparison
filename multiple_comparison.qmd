# Objectives

-   get an understanding of issues related to multiple comparisons in clinical trials

The theoretical background is based on @schumacher2008methodik and @moye200721.

# Theoretical background

@moye200721 states: "Multiple comparisons (or multiple testing situations) are simply the collection of statistical hypothesis tests that are executed at the conclusion of a research effort." This might for example be the case when there are multiple endpoints or when conducting subgroup analyses.

::: callout-note
Recall that a *type 1 error* (or false positive) is the probability of rejecting the null although the null is true. $\alpha$, the significance level, is the upper acceptable limit for a type 1 error.

::: callout-note
Recall that the p-value is defined as the probability of getting a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one we observed, given the $H_0$ is true.

@moye200721 further states: "The process is straightforward. The investigators should first identify each of the analyses that they wish to assess at the studyâ€™s conclusion. Once this exhaustive process of analysis identification has completed, the investigators should then choose the small number of endpoints for which a type I error rate will be allocated. It is over this final subset of endpoints that the overall type I error level will be controlled. Other analyses that cannot be recognized prospectively will fall into the class of exploratory analyses."

## Difference global and multiple $\alpha$

Suppose we have k null hypotheses $H^0 ... H^k$, then the global $\alpha$ is the limit for the probability of rejecting *at least* one of these hypotheses although they are all true. The multiple $\alpha$ is the limit for the probability of rejecting *at least* one from a **subset** of these hypotheses although they are true. In case of k multiple null hypotheses, the multiple $\alpha$ is calculated as $$1-(1-\alpha)^k$$ This equation (there is at least one type 1 error among the hypotheses tests) is also known as the familywise type 1 error level $\xi$ (after Bonferroni). An assumption is, that each test is independent.

# Single-step tests
This paragraph refers to @dmitrienko2017analysis.

## Bonferroni
The Bonferroni test rejects $H_i$ if $p_i <= \alpha / m$ where i=1,...,m. The individual adjusted p-value is
$$\tilde{p}=mp_i, i=1,...,m$$ 
## Sidak
The Sidak test rejects $H_i$ if $p_i <= 1-(1-\alpha)^{1/m} $ where i=1,...,m. The individual adjusted p-value is
$$\tilde{p}=1-(1-p_i)^m, i=1,...,m$$ 
::: callout-note
Both tests can also be used to test the global null hypothesis. The global null is rejected whenever any of the individual null hypotheses is rejected.
For the Bonferroni method the adjusted p-value for the global test is
$$\tilde{p}=m min(p_1,...,p_m)$$
and for the Sidak method it is
$$\tilde{p}=1-(1-min(p_1,...,p_m))^m$$
:::

# Closed testing methods
Hypotheses are connected in a closed family. 

## Holm stepwise test
Compute the p-value from the Bonferroni global test. Reject H if $\tilde{p}<=\alpha$. 
For example, consider the intersection hypotheses $H_{LM}$, i.e. {$H_L$ and $H_M$}. The intersection hypothesis consists of 2 original hypotheses $H_L$ and $H_M$. Reject the hypothesis if $\tilde{p}<=\alpha$.

Other closed testing methods are the Hochberg test or the Hommel test.

# Gatekeeping strategies
Here, in contrast to closed tests, the hypotheses refer to hierarchically ordered endpoints (in closed tests the ordering of the hypotheses is data driven) The trial endpoints are classified in a hierarchically manner.
The primary hypothesis serves as a gatekeeper and the secondary hypotheses will be tested only after the primary hypothesis has been rejected.
